## Get started?

Visit http://localhost:8080/ after installing dependencies (`npm install`) and starting the server (`node express_server.js`) to get started. Account creation is supported, as is new short link creation. 

View dependencies [here](/package.json).

For a given short link /urls/shortID, you can go directly to the saved URL by navigating to /u/shortID.
