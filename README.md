# TinyApp

## Like bit.ly but worse. 

### Created by nathan-ts for educational purposes only. Do not try and use this jank. 

Welcome to my educational project, TinyApp! This was created to learn about full stack apps, Node.js web servers, and EJS for templating. 

Visit http://localhost:8080/ after installing dependencies (`npm install`) and starting the server (`node express_server.js`) to get started. Account creation is supported, as is new short link creation. 

View dependencies [here](/package.json).

For a given short link /urls/shortID, you can go directly to the saved URL by navigating to /u/shortID.
